# DLV


Use the following command to call the program: 

           python main.py

To run program for imageNet properly, one needs to include the directories 'caffe_ilsvrc12' and 'ImageNet_Utils' into scripts/networks/imageNet/ directory. Otherwise, the program cannot find images to process. 

Please use the file ''configuration.py'' to set the parameters for the system to run. More instructions on how to change the parameters will come later.
